 Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This document provides the latest release information for the Digi IoT Library
 for .NET MAUI, which allows customers to easily develop cross-platform mobile
 applications in .NET MAUI that communicate with Digi IoT devices over
 Bluetooth Low Energy.

 Digi IoT Library for .NET MAUI v1.0.1, May 2024
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Supported Hardware:
      * Digi ConnectCore devices.
      * Digi XBee 3 devices:
